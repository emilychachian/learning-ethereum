# Learning Ethereum 

This is a repo to share my learning notes and code about Ethereum. It contains an application which allows investors to supervise where their money goes. 
The repo contains a project from an Udemy Course called **Ethereum and Solidity: The Complete Developer's Guide**, which was was developed by **[Stephen Grider](https://github.com/StephenGrider)** and can be found **[here](https://www.udemy.com/course/ethereum-and-solidity-the-complete-developers-guide/)**.
